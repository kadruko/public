## 1. What data do we collect?

Our App collects the following data:
- Inventories
- Inventory Items
- Item Storages
- Categories
- Category to Item Assignments
- Device ID
- Changes to any data object mentioned above (Create, Update, Delete)

If you use the login feature, we additionally store
- User Information
  - Name (Full Name, First Name, Last Name)
  - E-Mail
  - Profile Picture
- Inventory-Assignments: The inventories you are allowed to access
- Invitations you have sent to share an inventory

## 2. How do we collect your data?

The data we collect is provided by the user using formulars in the app.
More explicitly, we collect and process data, when you:
- CRUD Inventories
- CRUD Inventory Items
- CRUD Storages
- CRUD Categories

The Device ID is generated when you start the app for the first time and is available for this application only.
An initial inventory is generated on first application startup or if you have deleted all other inventories.

If you use the login functionality, you are authenticating yourself with a Google account.
We are collecting the mentioned personal data from Google and store them in our server database to offer you a more personalized in-app experience.

By enabling the synchronization, we additionally collect data when you:
- Share an inventory: An invitation code will be created
- Join an inventory: An inventory-assignment is created

## 3. How will we use your data?

Our App collects data so that we can:
- Offer you the functionality to store your Inventory using the app
- Synchronize and share your Inventories with other users

The entered data is not shared with any third party.

In case you want to synchronize your data over multiple devices, we need your Google authentication to ensure that you are allowed to see your data.
Based on that, we can offer you a secure app experience.

By using the data synchronization, the local data changes are transferred via HTTPS (SSL encrypted) to an REST service hosted on `https://mythings.glowsoft.de`. If you are assigned to any inventory, your device is pulling the latest changes from this service and persists them to your local database.

## 4. How do we store your data?

Your entered data is stored locally on your mobile device first.
The locally stored data is being persisted in a SQLite database.
We keep your data as long as you are active in the app.
The local data can be deleted manually by the user all at once by uninstalling the app or cleaning up the app's data.

When you use data synchronization, the data is stored on our server in a PostgreSQL database.

## 5. Marketing

Currently, we do not send any marketing mails. At a later point of time, you will be able to unsubscribe here.

## 6. What are your data protection rights?

We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following.
